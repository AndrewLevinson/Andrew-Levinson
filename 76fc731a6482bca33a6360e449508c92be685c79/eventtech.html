                            throughout North America, Asia and Australia.
                            <span class="redacted">REDACTED [company name]</span> is known for supporting massive events such as the International
                            Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Most of their revenue comes from their Las Vegas market, which
                            operated differently than their smaller hotels across the rest of the US.

                        <h5>A Problem to Solve</h5>
                        <p>After the company's failed effort to consolidate multiple legacy systems across different markets
                            and regions over the course of 3 years, they brought us in to try again. The business decision
                            was ultimately made to rebuild one of their current custom platforms as opposed to starting fresh.
                        </p>
                        <p>After thorough review of the existing product, we identified the following problems to solve:
                        </p>

                                    <li>Confusing user experience that does not match business' real life processes</li>
                                    <li>Severe bugs preventing users from completing critical tasks</li>
                                    <li>Multiple markets with different business goals using a mixture of old legacy technology
                                        barely strung together</li>
                                    <li>No upper management visibility into essentials like profitability and inventory</li>
                                    <li>Various interaction design issues cause frustration and anger</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>We knew we needed to get all their users across multiple markets on a single custom software platform.
                            Even with our strong product team, this would be no small task. Aside from the technical challenges
                            our developers faced, it left me and the rest of the design team with a huge challenge:

                            <p>Before any research or testing efforts in business product design, it's always best to remember
                                the golden rule:

                            <h5>Approach</h5>
                            <p>The reality was our users had been burned before (some, many times) and were jaded and skeptical
                                that a new product team could come in from the outside and fix their software. We knew we
                                had to start having conversations with folks in the field immediately. It's not always easy
                                to talk to your users, though – especially when they're spread out all over the continent,
                                cost is a concern, and frankly, you haven't met any of them yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In order to employ the most cost effective but impactful strategy, we identified 3 main methods of research and testing that
                                worked efficiently for this engagement:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) surveys every two weeks in coordination with releases</li>
                                <li>In Person Group Sessions</li>
                                <li>1-on-1 In Person & Remote Testing</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <h5>1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h5>
                            <p>Right away, our team began releasing incremental changes through the staging and production environments
                                in a dual-track agile process, so we had an advantage from the beginning. We had the ability
                                to get feedback from users on live designs.
                            </p>
                            <p>This methodology is perfect for testing incremental changes in a staging environment with an
                                intentionally selected group of users from different levels and regions of the business.
                                It also empowers the selected response team because it makes users feel like an important
                                voice in the building process.</p>

                            <p>What I've learned from the UAT process, there's a few critical things that you need to make it
                                an effective testing method:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recruit a variety of users at different levels and regions that will consistently participate
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ask questions that require simple tasks to be completed in chunks</li>
                                    <li>Always ask how this release compares to the last one in order to track improvements over
                                        time
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>2. In Person Group Sessions</h5>
                            <p>While the best way to get feedback is from live features, the next best thing is working with
                                people in person, in real time, in a simulated environment. What I mean by real time is instead
                                of just showing some A/B concepts and having users pick what they like best (unreliable for
                                this task based product), instead we assembled groups of users and asked them to complete
                                tasks from start to finish as if they were really doing their job.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>While this method is more time consuming and expensive, I would argue it's the most valuable
                                for creating a shared understanding between designers and people who use your product.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>As you can see from the slide examples above, this format works best to accomplish larger tasks
                                that simulate a real work day. Taking breaks after chunks of tasks is important. Gathering
                                feedback and having group discussions about what went well, what didn't, and how to move
                                forward are the most valuable takeaways.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, taking a step away from the software and moving to sticky notes on a wall will
                                always facilitate a better discussion and ensure the entire group has a shared understanding
                                of next steps.</p>

                            <p>Some of my favorite sessions have come from this group format. It helps build rapport with your
                                users and gets people in a room that may otherwise never interact or only interact via email.
                                Remember, these sessions will produce valuable insights, but ultimately the simulation will
                                not match a true live environment. Make sure to continue to test the features via UAT surveys
                                that were simulated in these sessions once they are released. Most likely, for better or
                                worse, you'll learn something new.

                            <p>Finally, 1-on-1 sessions (both remote and in person) provide valuable information you may not
                                be able to gather from UAT surveys and group sessions. These sessions are ideal for walking
                                through tasks from start to finish and asking a lot of questions along the way. These are
                                especially helpful when the participant speaks their thoughts aloud when completing the tasks.</p>
                            <a href="../images/event/oneonone.png" target="_blank">
                                <img src="../images/event/oneonone.png" width="100%">
                                <p class="center caption">You can see here, the in-person sessions are generally pretty casual</p>
                            </a>
                            <br>
                            <p>Providing a casual environment with no more than two interviewers in the room allows participants
                                to open up and say what they really mean. Often, we designers forget that users may not be
                                willing to be completely transparent with us if they don't think we're on their side - especially
                                when we ask them to complain to us.</p>
                            <p>Usually, the most negative information is spilled in these direct 1-on-1 sessions. It's good
                                to give users time to vent so they can see at least someone is listening, even it it doesn't
                                feel like it.</p>

                            <p>It's advisable to follow a script here, especially since these interviews are best to gather
                                targeted feedback on certain processes or new features. I've tested concept designs in tools
                                like InVision as well as built features tested in a staging environment successfully.</p>

                                <li>Remember, you're always after the true business process and goal for the task. The software
                                    should simply enable its users to complete those tasks, not define how they're done.</li>
                                <li>It's okay if you don't get through all the questions in your script or all the activities
                                    planned for a session. While you should ensure that each session is valuable, it's more
                                    important to listen to what participants want to tell you. Chances are, they have some
                                    things on their mind.</li>
                                <li>Convincing stakeholders of a design decision or direction is much easier when you have quantified

                                </a>
                                <p>This concept for an profitability by item view came straight from user discussions about
                                    building quotes. The hyper detailed views needed when building quotes didn't allow users
                                    to see the full picture when they needed.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>

                                </a>
                                <p>One of the first things we did was redesign the Sales Order Overview page. A card based layout
                                    made sense, especially since there's a lot of user inputed variable content. Sales Orders
                                    can be weeks long with hundreds of rooms and items, or just a single-room half day event.
                                    This layout style allows for either extreme, but optimized for the average order seen
                                    here.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <a href="../images/event/1a - Edit Items Table.png" target="_blank">

                                </a>
                                <p>Building an order at the most granular level, consists of adding equipment and labor lines
                                    to the room setup at the event. This table the user builds is then used for quoting,
                                    logistics, and billing activities. It is arguably the most critical feature of the entire
                                    system and because of this, we spend the most time and money researching and testing
                                    these workflows with users.</p>

                                <p>Speed was a major factor in rebuilding the edit items feature set. We added a configurable
                                    favorites panel that each user could customize for themselves.</p>

                                <p>After the sales process is completed, the equipment needs to be sourced. Anyone in the logisitcs
                                    or asset management world knows this can be a pain. We built a tool to help users quickly
                                    generate Transfer Orders, in order to borrow gear from other venues or their respective
                                    warehouses – often in bulk.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>While trying to source equipment from other venues and warehouses, often times the exact
                                    SKU on the sales order (quote) isn't available. We built a Substitutions feature to allow
                                    users to expand their sourcing to include similar items that may be acceptable for this
                                    event.
