                            This replaces an arduous manual process where retirees needed to send forms back and forth in

                            Their current portal for pension employees did not provide the ability to submit relevant information
                            and make election decisions to kick off their retirement. Employees had to mail paper forms back
                            and forth to make their pension elections and could often take months to complete. Additionally,
                            their competitors were using this as a way to win business.

                            the sales process); however, one of the best hard rules we established was in-person workshops.
                            To really understand the problem, the product, the vision, the users, the tech, and establish
                            a clear roadmap, you need the most important people physically in a room together.</p>

                        <p>After a full day working session, a demo of their current low functionality website, and informal
                            interviews with recent retirees from our own network, we learned a lot about the pension election
                            process.
                        </p>
                        <h5 style="font-weight: 600" class="center">Basically, it sucks.
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            It's often a complicated and confusing process for one of the most important financial decisions of your life. Here's some
                            of our specific findings:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical forms sent back and forth take a long time and cause stress while waiting</li>
                            <li>Estimated calculations for monthly annuity payments are often not exactly correct and need
                                to be changed, which is confusing and frustrating</li>
                            <li>Our client uses a literal spreadsheet (yes, an actual Excel spreadsheet) for their back-end
                                technology and while it's accurate, it has given them a negative industry reputation</li>
                            <li>Many participants prefer the "white glove" personal service and may not enjoy a mandatory
                                online experience, especially one with no direct human contact
                            </li>
                            <li>The ability to process pensions online appears on many business's (but not employees) must-haves
                                when signing up with a new pension provider</li>
                            <li>Oftentimes, participants children or grandchildren are doing the online work for them on
                                iPhones, tablets, XBOX, etc. – especially for older folks who aren't used to modern web technology
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>What I Did</h5>
                        <p>I knew the best way to communicate our understanding of the problem, was to build a simple clickable
                            prototype to demo during our pitch meeting.
                        </p>
                        <p>In light of our learnings above, I focused the prototype on the following objectives:
                            <ol>

                                <li>Simplest path to Retire Online</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Guided navigation, distinct view and edit modes, and clear progress indicators all
                                        help to make an often confusing experience, much simpler</li>
                                    <li>Help is always available and it's clear what your options are the entire way
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Intuitive & Accessible</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Since the typical retirement age is late 60s and oftentimes pensions are provided
                                        to companies whose employees often don't use computers regularly, this needed to
                                        be as basic as possible</li>
                                    <li>Simple screens, large font sizes, and clear visual affordances will make this product
                                        easy to use for everyone
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Responsive Design</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Card based layouts and full page overtake forms allows for flexibility on many different
                                        device types and sizes
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>How I Did It</h5>
                        <p>Now that I knew my objectives and agreed with my product manager on the goals of this engagement,
                            it was time to start sketching out some ideas.</p>
                        <a href="../images/pension/sketches" target="_blank">
                            <img src="../images/pension/sketches" width="100%">
                            <p class="center caption">Some Early Sketches</p>
                        </a>

                        <p>Early on when discussing the process and users, I was inspired by Intuit's financial products
                            like Mint and TurboTax. The ability to guide users through a checklist of steps which ultimately
                            ends in submitting a package of information applies just as much to tax filing as it does to
                            pension processing.</p>

                        <p>After I started to become comfortable with the feel of the designs, I made a list of the features
                            in the MVP I wanted to capture in this Retire Online experience:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provide basic information about myself, my spouse, and any other relevant financial data</li>
                                <li>Understand my election options and make a decision</li>
                                <li>Save my progress</li>
                                <li>Ask for help if I need it</li>
                                <li>Review my submission</li>
                            </ul>
                            I was confident that if I could incorporate these features into a simple linear prototype, we had a good shot at winning
                            the engagement.

                                <p>After submitting their pension information and election decisions, participants can review
                                    their summary and processing status. This ends the online portion of the election process.
                                    Now, when users log in they will be taken to this read only summary page.</p>

                        <h5>Key Learnings</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remember, you're always after the true business process and goal for the task. The software
                                should simply enable its users to complete those tasks, not define how they're done</li>
                            <li>Focus on problem => solution style thinking rather than interfaces in working sessions
                            </li>
                            <li>Don't make assumptions about users without research. Initially, I heard Pension Web App and
                                immediately thought old desktop PCs, but later learned that wasn't completely true – participants
                                children and grandchildren were doing this on behalf of the primary user from their own modern
                                devices as well</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h5 style="font-weight: 600" class="center">All this to say, get the right people in the room, and
                            the product vision will be clear.</h5>
