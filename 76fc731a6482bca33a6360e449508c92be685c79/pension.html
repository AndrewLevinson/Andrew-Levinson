                            <span class="redacted">REDACTED [company name]</span> came to us with a very specific problem. Their current portal

                            decisions to kick off their retirement. Employees had to mail paper forms back and forth to make
                            their pension elections and could often take months to complete. Additionally, their competitors
                            were using this as a way to steal business.

                        <p>It seems as though not only did we need the users to regain trust in the product, but we needed our
                            stakeholders to get bought back into their vision for a unified custom software solution.</p>
                        <p>Before any research or testing efforts in business product design, it's always best to remember the
                            golden rule:
                        </p>

                        <h6 class="section-head">Research & Testing Methods</h6>
                        <h5>Approach</h5>
                        <p>The reality was our users had been burned before (some, many times) and were jaded and skeptical
                            that a new product team could come in from the outside and fix their software. We knew we had
                            to start having conversations with folks in the field immediately. It's not always easy to talk
                            to your users, though – especially when they're spread out all over the continent, cost is a
                            concern, and frankly, you haven't met any of them yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to employ the most cost effective but impactful strategy, we identified 3 main methods of research and testing that
                            worked efficiently for this engagement:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) surveys every two weeks in coordination with releases</li>
                            <li>In Person Group Sessions</li>
                            <li>1-on-1 In Person & Remote Testing</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h5>1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h5>
                        <p>Right away, our team began releasing incremental changes through the staging and production environments
                            in a dual-track agile process, so we had an advantage from the beginning. We had the ability
                            to get feedback from users on live designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>This methodology is perfect for testing incremental changes in a staging environment with an intentionally
                            selected group of users from different levels and regions of the business. It also empowers the
                            selected response team because it makes users feel like an important voice in the building process.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>What I've learned from the UAT process, there's a few critical things that you need to make it an
                            effective testing method:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Recruit a variety of users at different levels and regions that will consistently participate
                                </li>
                                <li>Ask questions that require simple tasks to be completed in chunks</li>
                                <li>Always ask how this release compares to the last one in order to track improvements over
                                    time
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>2. In Person Group Sessions</h5>
                        <p>While the best way to get feedback is from live features, the next best thing is working with people
                            in person, in real time, in a simulated environment. What I mean by real time is instead of just
                            showing some A/B concepts and having users pick what they like best (unreliable for this task
                            based product), instead we assembled groups of users and asked them to complete tasks from start
                            to finish as if they were really doing their job.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>While this method is more time consuming and expensive, I would argue it's the most valuable for
                            creating a shared understanding between designers and people who use your product.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>As you can see from the slide examples above, this format works best to accomplish larger tasks that
                            simulate a real work day. Taking breaks after chunks of tasks is important. Gathering feedback
                            and having group discussions about what went well, what didn't, and how to move forward are the
                            most valuable takeaways.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, taking a step away from the software and moving to sticky notes on a wall will always
                            facilitate a better discussion and ensure the entire group has a shared understanding of next
                            steps.

                        <br>
                        <p>Some of my favorite sessions have come from this group format. It helps build rapport with your users
                            and gets people in a room that may otherwise never interact or only interact via email. Remember,
                            these sessions will produce valuable insights, but ultimately the simulation will not match a
                            true live environment. Make sure to continue to test the features via UAT surveys that were simulated
                            in these sessions once they are released. Most likely, for better or worse, you'll learn something
                            new.

                        <h5>3. In Person & Remote 1-on-1 Sessions</h5>
                        <p>Finally, 1-on-1 sessions (both remote and in person) provide valuable information you may not be
                            able to gather from UAT surveys and group sessions. These sessions are ideal for walking through
                            tasks from start to finish and asking a lot of questions along the way. These are especially
                            helpful when the participant speaks their thoughts aloud when completing the tasks.</p>
                        <a href="../images/event/oneonone.png" target="_blank">
                            <img src="../images/event/oneonone.png" width="100%">
                            <p class="center caption">You can see here, the in-person sessions are generally pretty casual</p>
                        </a>
                        <br>
                        <p>Providing a casual environment with no more than two interviewers in the room allows participants
                            to open up and say what they really mean. Often, we designers forget that users may not be willing
                            to be completely transparent with us if they don't think we're on their side - especially when
                            we ask them to complain to us.</p>
                        <p>Usually, the most negative information is spilled in these direct 1-on-1 sessions. It's good to give
                            users time to vent so they can see at least someone is listening, even it it doesn't feel like
                            it.

                        <p>It's advisable to follow a script here, especially since these interviews are best to gather targeted
                            feedback on certain processes or new features. I've tested concept designs in tools like InVision
                            as well as built features tested in a staging environment successfully.</p>

                            <li>Remember, you're always after the true business process and goal for the task. The software should
                                simply enable its users to complete those tasks, not define how they're done.</li>
                            <li>It's okay if you don't get through all the questions in your script or all the activities planned
                                for a session. While you should ensure that each session is valuable, it's more important
                                to listen to what participants want to tell you. Chances are, they have some things on their
                                mind.

                                    be completed now, allows for flexible screen sizes and provides a natual suggested workflow
                                    that isn't too restrictive. Prior to final submission, users will be taken to this as
