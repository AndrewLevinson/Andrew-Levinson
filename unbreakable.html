                        <h5>A Problem to Solve</h5>
                        <p>Clearly, people like data-driven sports reporting. There’s been an influx of interactive infographics across major platforms, deeper box score tracking, predictive analytics, and the rise of stat-based sports products like fantasy sports. Through research and validation, I discovered that it’s apparent that even though most mainstream sports fans enjoy this data-driven positioning in sports, there aren’t many products that allow users to pull this type of content on their own.</p>

                            <h5>It Needs a Name</h5>
                            <p>First, I needed a name. Using multiple naming exercises and formats, I cycled through possible types of names (descriptive, literal, metaphoric, etc.) and landed on “Unbreakable.”</p>

                            </div>

                            <p> Unbreakable is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the notion that there are very few records in sports that are truly unbreakable. As incredible as they seem at the time, an athlete always ends up coming along that breaks the greatest records in the world.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Initial Concept</h5>

                            <p>As with any early stage idea, I do a lot a lot of thinking, writing, and sketching immediately. Some of the earliest sketches included a sports trivia section and a simple lookup tool.</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="three columns"><br></div>

                            <p style="margin-top: 2.5%">After early iterations, I made some assumptions and began research in order to validate my claims. I would soon discover all the challenges associated with chatbot interactions and complex data visualization.</p>

                            <h5>User Research</h5>
                            To kick off my research, I surveyed many different types of digital sports product users. From casual and mainstream fans all the way to sports data power users, I wanted to find out about the following user habits and opinions in the following areas:

                            <p>1. This app cannot be a chatbot/records feature - it must be a full sports app that does everything including tracking favorite teams, scores/schedules, and all trending sports news.</p>
                            <p>2. Users enjoy sports data and entertainment like data-driven reporting, records tracking/trending, and sports trivia. </p>
                            <p>3. Everyone is using their phones for sports but they use sources like google searches, wiki, and league sites to look up records and stats (no apps for infographics, records tracking, or stat query) No good tools and it takes too long. </p>
                            <p>4. Content they like re: sports data is pushed to them on tv or in social posts, but they cannot pull info or customize type BR and ESPN main competitors. </p>

                            <h5>User Personas</h5>
                            <p>After receiving and analysing the survey results, I decided to follow up with some respondents who look up statistics and sports records, as well as more mainstream sports users looking to get more out of their current apps. By creating a few personas, I was able to bring more empathy to the early phases and throughout the entire project.

                            <h5>User Stories & Flows</h5>
                            <p>Using Google Sheets and draw.io, I created both user stories and user flows based on my research & motivation to satisfy my MVP requirements. For new users, onboarding and tool tips are especially crucial for understanding data cards, chatbot interactions, adding favorites, and general navigation. For existing users, interacting with the data cards, records tracking, chatbot, news feed, and scores are all critical for the MVP.

                            <p> By prioritizing my user stories, I was able to reduce the potential “feature bloat” for the first version of Unbreakable - this is how I ended up at the MVP list in the section above.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                            <p>It was important to use an iterative process for wireframing stages. I used Balsamiq for medium-fi wireframing. During the wireframing process, the main focus was to visualize and test the user flows. After some initial testing, I determined that the segmentation of sections via a sticky tab bar at the bottom of the interface provided the best navigation strategy for users.

                                During the process, I incorporated a few rounds of real user testing with a script. Valuable feedback that was incorporated at this phase included: Confusion between search and chatbot interactions yielded changes to the site map, including the chatbot dedicated tab which all user requests and queries run through Visual and functional consistency between interaction of data items, like results/related/trending cards, matchups, and record cards To help users understand the apps functionality and navigation, I added more interactive content to the onboarding and sign up artboards </p>

                            <h5>Branding and Style</h5>
                            <p>Starting with pencil and pad, I iterated on many ideas for Unbreakable. It began with the “Unbreakable” text with distress markings streaking throughout the letters. In an attempt to become more abstract but push the concept that all records are meant to be broken, I landed on a single slash between “Un” and ‘Breakable” with a color change between the prefix and the word. In grayscale and at smaller sizes, the white “Breakable” text is much more dominant and visible, adding to the notion and tone of the product. Pulling away from the literal and into the abstract allows the brand to speak for itself without losing the brand’s density.</p>



                            <div class="row center">
                                <div class="twelve columns">
                                    <h5>Logo Design</h5>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <br>


                            <p>When building the visual style for Unbreakable, I wanted to convey a playfulness but also maintain a clean design. The sea-green and bright red colors allow for a less serious and fun tone, while the typefaces (Montserrat for headers and Work Sans for body) are robust. <br>The sans-serif typefaces with high x-heights are particularly important, because for a mobile app with densely packed information, legibility and readability are the highest priority. Additionally, in an effort to not sacrifice all character in the name of readability, Montserrat for headers has an additional quirkiness where the content has flexibility and life. Work Sans also increases the size of certain parts of the type anatomy for optimal use for screens at small sizes.
                            </p>

                            <p>I created my prototype in Flinto. You can download it here (using the free Flinto app, you can view on your mobile device for full context). Using Flinto, I was not only able to create unique transitions between screens and views, but able to provide the needed interaction design to the signature items and features of the app: data cards (flipping and expanding), chatbot thread messaging, and onboarding animation to name a few. </p>

                            <p>
                                After a few sets of user tests I was able to revise a couple key sections: Color System and Visual Design Creating a sub-system for the visual system and colors to exclusively appear in the records and data cards increased consistency across the entire app. Users can define when they’re looking at a data-item (data cards in cards tab, data items in chatbot tab, and records cards) Additionally, chunking information is extremely important, especially in the expanded data card view (where a lot of info is packed in closely together). By using lighter and unique lines to separate sections and adding more breathing room to the sections, users can focus on large quantities of chunked information without feeling overwhelmed. Interaction design: Improving the chatbot experience became apparent when, during testing, users weren’t sure how to have a conversation with the chatbot (when to answer, ask questions, possible results) This was less to do with the content of the thread and more of the prototypes job to guide users through a sample interaction with the chatbot. By allowing more tips and tutorial-style responses, as well as the ability to review the entire thread (after the initial conversation), allowed users to review chatbot history and understand the different types of chatbot related events can occur in a full version (questions, related, explore,etc)

                            <h5>Key Learnings</h5>
                            <p>Creating and revising Unbreakable from concept to prototype was an intense and rewarding experience. While I consider myself a better designer in many areas after this project, here is a short list of my most significant reflections: Iterative branding process. Don’t be so quick to jump from paper to screen. If the branding system isn’t finished, keep sketching. Take the space to tell the user about your products. Onboarding screens and tutorials can often go overlooked when creating the product itself; however, user testing proved that your customer won’t revisit your app unless they know exactly what they’re signing up for. Expanding the video clips in the onboarding section and adding more tutorial content to the chatbot thread during the wireframing and visual design phases proved to be fruitful when evaluating conversion rates. MVP - don’t overlook necessary features that aren’t unique to your app. Understanding through research that user’s aren’t likely to use another sports app unless it include updates on their favorite teams, a news feed, and scores & schedules was imperative to discover early in the discovery phase. Do you have a product or really just a feature? Initial concepts only included a chatbot for records and data cards; however, they did not include favorites tracking, scores, and general sports news (non-data-driven). An app without those features (although simpler) would not have made it into mainstream sports users daily active rotation of apps. Consistency, consistency, consistency. Making sure every type of item’s design and interaction is consistent across the entire app.
